Last week I spoke with Sergio about blogs... We shared perspectives and he showed me both [his personal blog](https://drumsoverbogota.com/) as well as an archival of local punk records ([link here](https://elmuladar.com/))
I've been thinking a lot about this particular topic... about a space which is mantained outside corporations and their own particular political interests...
I decided to keep mine, to subjectivize myself towards the action of self-writing... 
<br>
There's been a lot of things I've been meaning to write, but today i will share something simple:

Several weeks ago, me alongside Oto Duarte, recorded some Harsh Noise, Electronic, drums and objects jam. The original goal is to make a track for a compilation of noisy tracks around the punk cosmology.
It was plenty fun. The real challenge is to make the actual track... We decided to make it cut-up-ish, in the style of the Harsh Noise trend around late 90s early 2000s.

Either way, in my down-times in work I decided to practice my Max-MSP kung-fu by following tutorials on the web and developed a sort of 2d axis multichannel sampler using the mc.2d.wave~ object.
The orange markers on the waveform portrait the different playheads. I have control of their pitch as well as their position on the sound file.
The patch is heavily based on a [tutorial](https://youtu.be/0dAQ524sXsU). I only really implemented some bpatchers in order to make the mc part a little more pleasant to the eye and easier to perform with.

The recording I'm about to drop was the first try of an audio file of the rehearsal in my system.

I liked how massive it is, the slow progression towards maximum intensity, the stereo-field which was completely automated...
It's a kind of tribute on the work of [Carl Stone](https://youtu.be/15ijY1HqzgQ), a composer known for his extensive use of the 2d.wave~ object
