Last week I spoke with Sergio about blogs... We shared perspectives and he showed me both [his personal blog](https://drumsoverbogota.com/) as well as an archival of local punk records ([link here](https://elmuladar.com/))
I've been thinking a lot about this particular topic... about a space which is mantained outside corporations and their own particular political interests...
I decided to keep mine, to subjectivize myself towards the action of self-writing... 
There's been a lot of things I've been meaning to write, but today i will share something simple:

Several weeks ago, me alongside Oto Duarte, recorded some Harsh Noise, Electronic, drums and objects jam. The original goal is to make a track for a compilation of noisy tracks around the punk cosmology.
It was plenty fun. The real challenge is to make the actual track... We decided to make it cut-up-ish, in the style of the Harsh Noise trend around late 90s early 2000s.

Either way, in my down-times in work I decided to practice my Max-MSP kung-fu by following tutorials on the web and developed a sort of 2d axis multichannel sampler using the mc.2d.wave~ object
(s/o to Ned Rush). I only implemented some bpatchers in order to make it a little more pleasant to the eye.



The recording I'm about to drop was the first try of an audio file of the rehearsal in my system.

I liked how massive it is, the slow progression towards maximum intensity, the stereo-field which was completely automated...
It's a kind of tribute on the work of [Carl Stone](https://youtu.be/15ijY1HqzgQ), a composer known for his extensive use of the 2d.wave~ object
