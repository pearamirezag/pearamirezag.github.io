## On Sharing


 ![resma_bocetos.jpeg]({{site.baseurl}}/_posts/resma_bocetos.jpeg)
I have a huge brick-like pile of drawings and sketches that I've been collecting for the past semester of so, since I took a break form using my iPad as my main drawing tool.

Last week i gathered with a friend because she wanted a drawing of mine. We drank tee, talked and looked at this scribbles for nearly 5 hours and didn't even finished looking at them all.. There are indeed a LOT of drawings.

I mean, the point in this post is to release a feeling I'm holding right now... I could publish them on instagram, yeah sure, each by each, but why?... Why share at all? Make them public so I can grow my "audience" somehow (?), to receive likes from the same 5 people who are aware and care of what I do (?) (don't get me wrong, I appreciate a lot their support). Isn't t

My mind is troubled because I' deviated from my newly acquired mindset of 

_*chop wood and carry water*_ 

> “The novice says to the master, ‘What does one do before enlightenment?’
‘Chop wood. Carry water,’ replies the master.
The novice asks, ‘What, then, does one do after enlightenment?’
‘Chop wood. Carry water.'”

> “My daily activities are not unusual,
I’m just naturally in harmony with them.
Grasping nothing, discarding nothing.
In every place there’s no hindrance, no conflict.
My supernatural power and marvelous activity:
Drawing water and chopping wood.”

> “How miraculous and wondrous,
Hauling water and carrying firewood!”
