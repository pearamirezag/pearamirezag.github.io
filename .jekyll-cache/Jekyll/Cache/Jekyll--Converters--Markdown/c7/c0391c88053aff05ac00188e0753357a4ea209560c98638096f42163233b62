I"°<p>As some people may know already, Iâ€™ve been dealing a fight against some of my deepest addictions which is social media. Iâ€™ve been reading a lot about it and I have implemented as well several methods found online in order to try to regulate my behaviours inside the net. One thing Iâ€™ve discovered is the daunting expectancy of approval that the â€˜likesâ€™ system provokes in me. Iâ€™ve found myself shamelessly looking over and over how many people look at my Instagram stories, or how many likes a link Iâ€™ve shared has been seen on Twitter. My mind just works in a way that is somehow addicted to numbers, to the ability to measure anything, whether it is worthy or not.</p>
