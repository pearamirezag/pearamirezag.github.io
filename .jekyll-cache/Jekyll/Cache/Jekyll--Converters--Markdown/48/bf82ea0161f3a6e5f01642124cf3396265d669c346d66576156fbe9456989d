<p>It‚Äôs been a long time since I publish something in here, but I would like to keep
things moving. Since I don‚Äôt record my music that much I think it could be interesting
to share about videos and audio that has been recorded from my live shows:</p>

<p>This one was made by Luminaria Vespertina, which is conformed by Wilson Lozano on his Go-Pro camera.
Actually there are a several videos of this date, some with better quality than others.
<br />
This video got a got general impression of how the concert sounded but I personally loved the last minute recorded by Juan Manuel Jaramillo:

I think it captured the high level volume of the excellent sound system in Matik-Matik.
<br />
On the technical side of things, I‚Äôm really enjoying the stutter pedal programming I did on my Axoloti-driven pedal.
<br />
It‚Äôs the metal box in the right, with the knobs and the footswitches

Since I got that board, around 2016 after my trip to Germany, I was really interested into programming my own stutter, granular and other
buffer-modification effects but never actually got it to work out. Recently, after exploring Max/Msp again, finally understood typical applications for buffer and made myself a stutter pedal
with Ring Modulation :)</p>

<p>This was another concert of mine recorded last week in which I was invited sporadically to the ‚ÄúTaller de Alto Desempleo‚Äù concert sessions organized by my friend Daniel Piedrahita in his art-studio in Rat Trap.
One of the conditions of the concerts is to play music at moderate levels of volume, just because his atelier is in a residential area and it‚Äôs not acoustically prepared for loud concerts.
My take on this challenge was to play music on a Bose Soundlink+ system, in mono, and use the iphone Speakers as well.
<br />
<br />
The apps I used for this concert were mainly <a href="https://www.jhhl.net/iPhone/Droneo/"> Droneo </a> and a File Player running in <a href="http://kymatica.com/apps/aum">AUM</a> and <a href="http://ruismaker.com/ripplemaker/"> Ripplemaker </a> running on my iPhone.
That week I was exploring a the possibilities of Droneo, and thinking about Just Intonation and other tuning systems. I really like that feature but I‚Äôm only on my way to learn to use it properly yet.</p>
